CPTS - 591 Elements of Network Science Project - Spring 2024 

Social media platforms often grapple with negativity and trust issues. This project utilizes social network analysis (SNA) on a social media platform (like Reddit) to explore information flow and community dynamics. We analyze positive and negative connections between communities (subreddits) to understand how balance and status theories apply in online social networks. This research aims to contribute to fostering healthier online discourse and community building.
